Really sorry about your dad, Karl. He clearly lived a good life, &
we're all better off because he graced this planet w/his presence. I
didn't know him, though I was acquainted w/his work. But this obituary
makes it very obvious that his life has touched us all in a positive
way. I hope you'll find comfort in just knowing that. Thanks for
sharing w/us--& thanks for signing your note so we'd know how to
address you. Hang in, stay strong.
