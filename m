Subject: [TechTalk] Twitter Bans Third-Party Apps

Hi everyone,

As I've suspectedfor a while, Twitter is no longer allowing third party apps. I spent $30 on the Twitteriffic app a few years ago and I was considering buying the Spring App for Twitter. I'm glad I didn't and I'm upset that I spent money on an app that no longer works.

Below is a link to an article about this.
