Kyle,
Thanks for echoing some of my thoughts.
I honestly was confused, remain confused by the first posters question.
There is no such thing as a blind community, because  blindness is not a=20
uniformed experience for anyone, at all.
References to quote the blind  quote as a composite whole, speaking=20
personally does more to dehumanize those who interact with technology=20
differently than almost anything else.
my concern though with your suggestions is the focus on a single tool,=20
which itself cannot be applied across the board.
Yes, the new Twitter owner fired the entire accessibility team, but how=20
are these services defining accessibility?
by its actual meaning regardless of technology used, works from=20
the keyboard for  example?
You keep speaking of Orca, but what if one cannot, or chooses not to use Or=
ca=20
at  all?
If the goal are options that lets individuals, regardless of label,=20
communicate with those they wish, and engage with the world as they=20
desire, then the access is based on progressive enhancement  design, or sho=
uld be, not=20
any specific screen reader if that resonates, speaking personally.
Such is because software based solutions are subject to becoming=20
noninclusive, where interaction based solutions, command line, works with=
=20
keyboard, has basic HTML in the floor even is scripting is placed on top,=
=20
work for the long term.
Just my own thoughts,
Karen
