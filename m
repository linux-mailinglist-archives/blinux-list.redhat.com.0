1. My comment regarding Linux is based on direct communications with 
Amazon staff,  who have confessed not to have heard of it,and  who have 
no direct contact with their so called 
accessibility team when problems arise.
2. them properly compiled  elinks and links function with java script.
3.  Access is tied to interaction which is why even later editions of lynx 
can manage some scripting, submit buttons for example.

4. since adaptive technology is often a substitution for the persons eyes, 
hands, brain, and the like, what gives you the right to state that 
technology choices are not tied to physical mandates?  How does your stance 
differ from those who claim that access need not exist at all,  or that 
all those sharing  a label are the same?
5. the names of access or other individuals at amazon confirming your 
assumption here?  the legal stance is that if a site serves the public, 
an individual can expect equal public access...which is why  alternative 
doors    are to exist  in the first place.
How do you know what low graphics can or cannot do if you do not follow 
their development?  This is about keyboard response which exists in 
graphical  browsers like elinks and links.

Realistically though, it is possible that they have stopped worrying about the very small number of people who still use text-based browsers and expect them to work for shopping, banking and other modern internet tasks. The thing is Linux accessibility in 2019 != lynx/links/elinks accessibility. In fact, this hasn't been the case since about 2008 or so

Even w3m doesn't fully support the w3c's own standards.

But to say that Amazon doesn't care about Linux accessibility because their site doesn't work with a text-based browser is at best a gross exageration, and is at worst a grave disservice to those of us who use Linux and a screen reader at the same time.
