I am not talking about searching, I am talking about signing in, not that 
I can  either physically use or duplicate your setup.
the amazon.com/access page  existing was never the question.  Instead the 
question is why the sign in page there is actually 15 pages long, with no 
alt tag designating the locations for email and password.
Indeed  the amount of clutter is atrocious and since the access is to be 
less cluttered,  one has to wonder as to their definition of simple.
  Further  how does their captcha better protect my account if it is not 
inclusive?
