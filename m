I agree with you entirely.  Amazon should just do this because it is good=
=20
business.  Want a simple path to using amazon?  go here...which used to be=
=20
the case.  Prefer the full site, here you go.
Speaking personally I find the way  terms like accessibility get used to=20
often feel disturbing because the assumption is that everyone sharing a=20
certain label, say disability, accommodates and are interchangeable for one=
=20
another.  My understanding of disabilities studies is though that the=20

the menu so people can choose for whatever reason, and you do grand=20
business...like Apple.
