According to  others here, Amazon actually staffs individuals in their 
accessibility  department who can at least reasonably explain about 
keyboard function.  Likewise the site used to work, even the  options 
provided  by  customer service used to work.  Further at least one figure 
from the  center  for disease control indicates that at least 25% of the us 
population experiences a  print disability that is not a few hundred 
people  potentially, it is a great deal more.

Now, they're so big, they don't care if a few hundred people don't use their site. It's like a four year old trying to box against George Foreman. He's not going to notice much lol.
