If I were to try your combination  it would result in my hospitalization 
because  the  speech synthesis involved in your combination has been 
medically proven to stimulate the dizzy centres of my brain...which is why access 
guidelines state that testing based on a single tool can still not produce 
access.  CSS exists for this reason.  Elinks is referenced because you 
kept speaking of text based browsers as if I had not tried more than one 
tool.    If even the amazon.com/access page, as it did previously, 
followed wcag 2.0, we could both use the site accommodating as our 
situations dictate.
Now if you are firm on your claim that someone using a combination of 
your tools will get the same results, I have a team of doctors who would 
love your pet scan results.
A shared label does not a shared experience make...and there is no such 
thing   as someone.
