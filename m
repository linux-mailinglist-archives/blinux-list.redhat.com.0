One thing that is a violation  of wacg 2.0 in principle, and a human 
rights violation as well is the assumption that if one person with the 
label, say blind, can use something, then everyone else with that label 
have been accommodated. Instead wacg 2.0 focuses on interaction, requiring 
that  all elements work from the keyboard, that existing user agents be 
supported, and discouraging defining access by any adaptive tool 
specifically.
In fact the technical baseline Claus of wacg 2.0 forbids suggesting one 
tool as a solution on a public   site because members of the public choose 
the best way to accommodate based on their individual bodies and 
situations.  unless a company is uniformly providing technology to 
everyone who may  encounter an access barrier, they cannot  require 
everyone to accommodate via their definitions.  You can use orca and 
Firefox,  good for you, and those who cannot?  is amazon allowed to deny 
them the right to shop because they are not you?
Of course not.  amazon can no more tell  a person how to accommodate their 
experience then they can tell a person what car  is allowed in the whole 
foods  parking lot.
That a single tool on your own computer works for you, does not make 
amazon usable by anyone besides yourself.
Size of a company makes no difference here because Amazon has far more 
resources available to insure  everyone can shop equally.
come  to think of it,  could not Domino's argue they have too few resources 
to  accommodate?  They would be wrong of course, simplification is less 
expensive.  But I wonder if that might be their argument?
