Hi folks,
sharing and asking for ideas about the following.
Has anyone visited amazon.com/access
lately in elinks and enjoyed success?  Lynx either for that matter, or 
anything  else?
Previously the main site the m.site and or the access site could result in 
something.
Now though  either
a, the site claims not to recognize cookies even after accepting them, 
lynx.
b. the site will not function without cookies, links and elinks, neither of 
which? actually supports cookies in the first place.
c. if  you  make multiple efforts to reach your account the site thinks 
you are  trying to hack presenting you with a captcha page with no  actual 
links on it.
d.  if you try to log in at amazon.com/access in a low graphics browser, or 
links or elinks, the sign in page is 15 pages long with no alt tags 
associated with where the information goes.
e. if amazon staff  provides you with their own captcha data, a work 
around they were using for the  badly constructed verification, it now 
also fails.
Amazon claims to have accessibility staff, but they seem to be no longer 
aware of the importance of Linux access.
So...thoughts and or ideas?
Thanks,
Karen
