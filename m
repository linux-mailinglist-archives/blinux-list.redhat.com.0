A participant in one of the Linux-related mailing lists to which I 
subscribe uses an HP server as his desktop workstation. I can't remember 
the model, but it's designed to be a relatively quiet machine that can 
run in an office environment - it isn't one of those noisy systems which 
needs to be kept in a data centre. It probably has remote administration 
capabilities as well.

You could probably obtain one at a good price from a company that sells 
ex-corporate hardware (machines that have been used for several years in 
a corporate environment and which are now being sold on).

Further afield, System76 is a well known vendor of Linux machines, 
although I haven't checked whether they offer anything within your budget.
