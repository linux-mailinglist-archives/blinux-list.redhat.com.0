Ultimately marketers make cultures and communities.  Those that never took
a marketing course won't understand so I'll explain.  Without communities
and cultures products and services couldn't be efficiently marketed and
lots of industries would loose lots of money.  Government funded
residential boarding schools for the blind in the past and that made
marketing to that created community that much easier.
