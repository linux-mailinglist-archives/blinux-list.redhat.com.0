I have said  over and over that access is not about blindness, it is about 
interaction.
The solution as others have also shared is making sure wcag 2.0 is 
followed,   making certain that browsers that function from the keyboard, 
use html and the like work...that  means a person using a voice browser gets 
in the door, or an augmented keyboard, or any number of screen readers
  that are not yours.
Individuals with learning disabilities use screen readers as well.
You chose to  defend your combination of tools as interchangeable to other 
people besides yourself.
The suggestion that your solution can  be projected onto anyone else at 
all, speaking personally, creates comparative discrimination  to 
suggesting that no access  should exist because, as I have heard 
misinformed people say as well,  my  <insert relationship> was blind and 
could   not use a computer, so  you cannot do that either, or insert 
person uses jaws, so you have to use that too.
One of the  points made by domino's and echoed in a prior post is correct. 
By  not establishing  firmly that wcag 2.0 is the  standard, something 
many other jurisdictions  around the world have done, the Supreme court 
will  simply  suggest the lower court conflicted rulings be addressed.
Those standards  seek inclusion for everyone, not a specific population, 
because inclusive design helps far more than one group of people 
when properly applied, because  many people in many settings do not want to 
or cannot load heavy graphics.
I am likewise concerned that the innovation  point made  in the second 
article shared will result in  greater inconsistencies too.  People making 
decisions much like ours.  My screen reader combination works for me, so 
every other body can just change to my tool.
Accessibility is a foundation on which  as many tools as possible can be 
used, not where one tool used by one person defines the door for the rest.
