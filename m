Excellent. Here's three grant sites just to get started.

https://www.ieeefoundation.org/Grants

https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/118.nsf/eng/00002.html

https://www.supermoney.com/disability-loans-grants/

There's an interesting looking Grant search site at grants.gov, but I couldn't use it
because apparently it requires javascript. Tsk.

I created my own screen reader (fenrir in just a couple of weeks and learned a lot while doing that. All That makes me really efficient working on accessibility related software and was also the reason why i was hired by F123 at its time.

I also added an OCR plugin for testing ;). Quite basic right now but fully functional. Currently i concentrate on rework orcas settings handling to be decentral for the plugin architecture. Thats really a chal  and takes a couple of month (a lot of work needed and i do it mostly in my spare time, so i have to pay my bills first ;), but once complete,we can remove a lot of smelling old code after that )

I think we need to figure out a way to pool resources and grab Chrys87 on Github and go here, can you make this, we've got X amount of resources, money, food, beer, coffeee, cats, etc, so how much do you need to make it? I mean. I want that text mode browser. There's bits and pieces in existing browsers, yes but nobody's ever packaged them all together.

But the bigger reason is, well, look at DragonFM, it shows that you can have a console file manager with desktop like shortcuts that does all the functionality of something like Caja or Nautlius, but in a terminal, with standard keyboard shortcuts.
