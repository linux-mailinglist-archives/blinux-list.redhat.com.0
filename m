1. elinks is not a text based browser.
2. the access  site is supposed to allow simple  usage, low graphics which 
might  include a text browser.
3. why does your usage, your key strokes, and your steps apply to me at 
all?
What makes your steps apply to anyone besides you, and what does that have 
to the millions of people who are not you?
