John Boyer here.

Thanks for all the memory refreshing. I've decided to use different consoles for different users via ctrl+alt+Fn, so i can run screen in each user. For one of the 
additional users screen behaves normally, but for the other it shows /bin/bash . Incidentally, I am using BRLTTY. it works fine. 

Sometimes the keyboard becomes totally unresponsive, but BRLTTY still responds to keys on the Braille display. I've just been doing a cold reboot. Suggestions 
appreciated.

Thanks,
John
