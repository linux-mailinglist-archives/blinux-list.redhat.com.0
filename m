I predict Dominos will have its clock thoroughly cleaned.  Precedent
even in the Supreme Court isn't on their side.
Congress made it clear what accessibility requirements are in the
accessibility process and that happened in 2010.  There's about 16
technical requirements and a Preamble to Section 508 and this was
something D.O.D. got measured against in 2012 when Obama required a
D.O.D.-wide accessibility report.  End result of that was the United
States Navy was Accessibility Leader and the United States Navy was
still left with serious problems and all other components had much work
to do.  I know about that having worked for the Navy during that time.
