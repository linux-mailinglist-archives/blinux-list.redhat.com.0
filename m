=2E.and there in is part of the problem.
One thing I have  discovered after about a month of  contacting Amazon=20
staff is  that  no direct link exists between  those in customer service,=
=20
and  those considered involved  with the low graphics end of things.=20
Customer service has a list of tools, which might have worked before, but=
=20
no longer work, with no direct avenue to address them.
For example, customer service sends a reset password link over and over to=
=20
get past the capcha barrier.  Problem now is that the site decides you are=
=20
making too many account attempts, creating an even less accessible image=20
test.
Those involved with  maintaining the access section of the site should=20
themselves test regularly, and stay alert with what access means across=20
populations...its their job.
Yet if  there is no direct line to them, how are they going to know there=
=20
are   problems?
Speaking personally, I do not resonate with a blind people concept as if=20
again anything applies to everyone sharing that label in the same fashion.=
=20
Still, if that is how amazon  is addressing the problem, talking to one or=
=20
a few people who in turn define access  by their personal accommodations,=
=20
then...well.
