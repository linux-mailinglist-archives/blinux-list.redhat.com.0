One thing I find unfortunate here is how many states apparently do not=20
follow the example of New York.  Access is a human right  and the state's=
=20
department  of justice facilitates such complaints as a result, if the=20
event  took place in the state.
In Ontario again where companies doing business must insure goods and=20
services  are equal, the process for a complaint does not require a lawyer.=
=20
Additionally, there is a division at the Provencal level providing legal=20
help.  The federal human rights process likewise does not require a=20
lawyer.  Companies must deal with individuals  when a complaint is filed.
Frankly speaking personally a bit of well placed and focused social media=
=20
work could attract attention faster than your ada legal process.
I would add again that access is not only tied to blindness.  still,=20
given the number of attorneys who identify as blind, finding some=20
willing to Handel litigation should be simple.
In any case, Amazon already expresses a willingness to  provide access,=20
there   is just  no direct link between that department, and the customer=
=20
base.
