the most you can do as an individual is  state clearly that accessibility 
is just that, defined by individuals.  Your experiences begin and end with 
you, because  no one embodies  the elements comprising your blindness 
experience but yourself.  To suggest even slightly that there are one size 
fits  more than one solutions prolong the problem.
In fact in Canada it is a human rights violation to insist those sharing a 
label accommodate the same, with wcag already adopted here, and in many 
other countries who likewise adapted the United nations convention on the 
rights of people with disabilities...a treaty skipped  in the us.  Do not 
measure what is possible by your, by your own admission, limited 
exposure.
